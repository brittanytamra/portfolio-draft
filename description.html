         <p>This was my final project in my web development program at Juno College formerly HackerYou. 
            We had the opportunity to create anything we wanted, our only requirement was to make our project responsive. I had done
            a few responsive exersises and was having a hard time uderstanding how I would add it to my project so I was
            looking forward to accomplishing this task. My other goals I had for my final project were, 
            I wanted to learn how to add multi pages, incorporate a drop down menu and add video. I decided I wanted to recreate a website of a 
             sneaker brand that I am a fan of by making the site my own. The brand is called Filling Pieces,
            they are a brand from Amsterdam and I love their style and creativity when it comes to their sneakers and I knew right away this
            was the project I wanted to do. Looking at the finished product, I am just really proud of what I accomplished. From
            not knowing how to code to creating this at the end, words can't decribe how happy and fulfilling this made me to not only complete
           this program but to finish this project.</p>
