              Hi. My name is Brittany Brathwaite, I come from a Customer Service background with a Business Administration 
              Diploma from Georgre Brown College. I have an extreme interest in the field of web development. I find this career
              to be rewarding offering a wide range of job opportunies and earning potential. As I pursued this career path I enrolled 
              and completed the Beginner Digital Skills course with Canada's Learning Code formerly Ladies Learning Code which I enjoyed immensely. 
              
          <p> I later enrolled and completed the Web Development program at Juno College formerlly HackerYou.
            I have continued to upgrade my skills and am currently enrolled in online courses in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
            My main goal is to become a Front End Web Developer and I strive to achieve this everyday by continuing to
            learn online and applying what I have learned by doing sample projects. It's hard work but very rewarding. Everyday
            I wake up, I'm excited to code, continuously learn and make that transition to becomming a Developer.</p>
