            <p>
              Hello there! I come from a customer service background with a Business Administration 
              Diploma from Georgre Brown College. My desire to want to learn to how to code happened after a seeing a few
              friends start their journey to become developers. I was recommended to start with Free Code Camp and then that
              lead me to taking the Begginer Digital Skills course with Canada's Learning Code formerly Ladies Learning Code.

              From there, I took the web development program at Juno College formerly HackerYou. 
          <p>I think within the last six months was when I got serious with myself and decided this was what I wanted to do hopefully one day as a career. So I
               started from scratch taking beginner HTML, CSS and JavaScript courses. 
               
               My goal is to work towards becomming a front end 
              web devloper. I strive to achieve that goal every day by doing online courses and I'm now starting to
               apply those skills by doing sample projects.  It's hard work but rewarding. Everday I wake up, I'm excided to code, continously learn
               and make that transition to become a developer.</p>
